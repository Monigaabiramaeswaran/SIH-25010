## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
![Uploading organic farming.jpg…]()


<h3>Sustainable farming for greener future</h3>
<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
The solution is a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application and chatbot that provides personalized crop advisory services. It integrates soil data, weather forecasts, and market trends to guide farmers in making informed decisions. With image-based pest detection, fertilizer guidance, and localized voice support, the system ensures inclusivity for digitally less-literate farmers. The platform also incorporates a feedback loop for continuous improvement and learning.</li>
<li>How it addresses the problem
Personalized Advisory – By combining soil health data, local weather forecasts, and crop history, farmers receive recommendations tailored to their specific farm rather than generic advice.

Pest & Disease Detection – Using AI-powered image recognition, farmers can upload crop images and instantly identify diseases or pests, reducing crop losses caused by late or incorrect diagnosis.

Fertilizer & Soil Guidance – The system provides precise fertilizer dosage based on soil condition, preventing overuse of chemicals, lowering input costs, and improving soil sustainability.</li>
<li>Innovation and uniqueness of the solution
Hyper-Localized Advisory – Unlike generic farming apps, this system integrates real-time soil, weather, and market data at the village or panchayat level, ensuring advice is context-specific and actionable.

AI + Voice + Multilingual Integration – Combines AI-powered decision support, image-based pest detection, and voice-enabled chatbot in local languages, bridging the digital literacy gap for small and marginal farmers.

Offline-first Functionality – Designed to work even in low-connectivity rural regions, with offline storage of recommendations and SMS/IVR-based updates.</li></ul>

## Technical Approach
<ul><li>Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware)
  Application Development

Mobile Platform: Android-first development using Kotlin/Java (majority of rural farmers use Android), with optional cross-platform support via Flutter.

Backend Services: Built using Spring Boot (Java) or Django (Python) for reliability and faster API integration.

Database: MySQL or Firebase Realtime Database for storing farmer profiles, crop data, and advisory records.

AI & Data Analytics

Crop & Pest Diagnosis: Deep learning models (CNN, ResNet, EfficientNet) for analyzing crop images.

Advisory Engine: Predictive analytics models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to recommend crops, fertilizers, and irrigation schedules.

Natural Language Chatbot: AI-driven multilingual chatbot using Rasa or Google Dialogflow.
</li>
<li>Methodology and process for implementation 
  Requirement Gathering & Research

Conduct field surveys with small and marginal farmers to understand local challenges, languages, and crop patterns.

Collaborate with agricultural universities, KVKs, and government agencies for datasets (soil, crop, pest, and weather).

System Design

Define user flows for farmers (advisory access, pest reporting, market prices).

Design a simple mobile-first interface with multilingual and voice support.

Plan backend architecture to handle real-time data (soil, weather, mandi prices).

Data Collection & Integration

Integrate APIs for weather forecasts, government soil health databases, and market price platforms.

Build a database of common crop diseases, pests, and fertilizer usage guidelines.

Enable farmers to contribute local knowledge through the feedback module.<b>(Flow Charts/Images/ working prototype)</b></li></ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<ul><li>Analysis of the feasibility of the idea
Technical Feasibility

Smartphones are widely available among farmers, and Android is the most used platform in rural India, making a mobile-first solution practical.

AI/ML models for pest detection and recommendation systems are already proven in similar domains and can be trained with existing agricultural datasets.

APIs for weather forecasting, soil health data, and mandi prices are publicly available, enabling seamless integration.

Offline functionality via SMS/IVR support makes the solution viable even in low-connectivity areas.

Economic Feasibility

Development cost is moderate as it uses open-source frameworks and cloud platforms.

Farmers can access the service at low or no cost if supported by government schemes, cooperatives, or agri-tech subsidies.

Reduction in fertilizer overuse, pest losses, and input costs will improve farmers’ profit margins, making adoption economically sustainable.

Operational Feasibility

The app will be designed with simple icons, local languages, and voice support, making it easy for semi-literate users.

Government agencies and NGOs can play a key role in farmer onboarding and training, improving adoption rates.

The solution can be deployed in phases, starting with pilot villages and scaling state-wide</li>
<li>Potential challenges and risks
Digital Literacy Barriers

Many small and marginal farmers may not be comfortable with smartphone apps.

Risk: Low adoption due to difficulty in using advanced features.

Mitigation: Provide voice-based guidance, simple icons, and training programs via NGOs, cooperatives, and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).

Connectivity Issues in Rural Areas

Internet penetration is uneven in villages.

Risk: Farmers may not receive real-time updates.

Mitigation: Enable offline advisory, SMS/IVR support, and local caching of recommendations.

Accuracy of AI Models

Crop diseases and soil conditions vary by region.

Risk: Incorrect pest detection or advisory may reduce trust in the system.

Mitigation: Train models with region-specific datasets and continuously improve accuracy through farmer feedback loops.</li>
<li>Strategies for overcoming these challenges
Digital Literacy Barriers

Design the app with voice-based navigation, regional languages, and simple icons.

Conduct village-level training camps with the help of agricultural extension officers, NGOs, and KVKs.

Connectivity Issues in Rural Areas

Implement offline-first design so core features work without internet.

Use SMS/IVR-based advisory delivery for farmers with basic phones.

Introduce data-light updates to reduce internet dependency.

Accuracy of AI Models

Train models on region-specific datasets (local pests, crops, soil conditions).

Introduce a farmer feedback loop where users can confirm or correct AI suggestions.

Partner with agriculture universities and ICAR to validate advisory content.</li></ul>
